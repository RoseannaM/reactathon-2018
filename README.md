# ASSEMBLE

## Introduction

> Created for the 2018 Reactathon, we developed Assemble to enable the participation of events and meetups.

## What it Does and How

> It takes advantage of [Netlifiy's](https://www.netlify.com/) oAuth and static hositing and Lambda's, [Hasura's](https://hasura.io/) database and graphQL helpers, [Tok Box's](https://tokbox.com/) video streaming service and [Event Brite's](https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/) Event Api to manage event Authorization.
